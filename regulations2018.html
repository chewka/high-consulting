        </p><p>a) In determining whether to grant, deny, or renew a license for a retail license or microbusiness license, the Bureau shall consider if an excessive concentration exists in the area where the licensee will operate. For the purposes of this section "excessive concentration" applies when either of the following conditions exist:
        </p><p>1) The ratio of licensees to population within the census tract or census division in which the applicant premises is located exceeds the ratio of licensees to population in the county in which the applicant premises is located, unless denial of the application would unduly limit the development of the legal market so as to perpetuate the illegal market for cannabis or cannabis products.
        </p><p>2) The ratio of retail licenses or microbusiness licenses to the population within the census tract, census division, or jurisdiction exceeds that allowable by local ordinance adopted under section 26200.
        </p><p>b) "Population Within the Census Tract or Census Division" as used in this section means the population as determined by the most recent United States decennial or special census. Such population determination shall not operate to prevent an applicant from establishing that an increase of resident population has occurred within the census tract or census division.
        </p><p>c) "Population in the County" as used in this section, shall be determined by the most recent annual population estimate for California counties published by the Demographic Research Unit, State Department of Finance.
        </p><p>d) Beginning July 1, 2018, the Bureau shall calculate the ratios described in subsection (a) of this section once every six months using the most current available data. The Bureau's consideration of whether to grant, deny, or renew a license shall be based upon the most recent ratio calculated by the Bureau on the date of the Bureau's decision.
        </p><p>e) The existence of an excessive concentration shall not be considered in determining whether to grant, deny, or extend a temporary license under Business and Professions Code section 26050.1.
        </p><p>f) The applicant may provide reliable evidence establishing, to the satisfaction of the Bureau, that a denial of a license would unduly limit the development of the legal market so as to perpetuate the illegal market for cannabis and cannabis products.

    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        The following include, but are not limited to, additional grounds that constitute a basis for disciplinary action:
        <br> (a) Failure to take reasonable steps to correct objectionable conditions on the licensed premises, including the immediately adjacent area that is owned, leased, or rented by the licensee, that constitute a nuisance, within a reasonable time after receipt of notice to make those corrections,  under Section 373a of the Penal Code. For the purpose of this subsection only, "property or premises" as used in Section 373a of the Penal Code includes the area immediately adjacent to the licensed premises that is owned, leased, or rented by the licensee.
        <br> (b) Failure to take reasonable steps to correct objectionable conditions that occur during operating hours on any public sidewalk abutting a licensed premises and constitute a nuisance, within a reasonable time after receipt of notice to correct those conditions from the Bureau. This subdivision shall apply to a licensee only upon written notice to the licensee from the Bureau. The Bureau shall issue this written notice upon its own determination, or upon a request from the local law enforcement agency in whose jurisdiction the premises is located, that is supported by substantial evidence that persistent objectionable conditions are occurring on the public sidewalk abutting the licensed premises. For purposes of this subsection:
        <br> (1) "Any public sidewalk abutting a licensed premises" means the publicly owned, pedestriantraveled way, not more than 20-feet from the premises, that is located between a licensed premises, including any immediately adjacent area that is owned, leased, or rented by the licensee, and a public street.
        <br> (2) "Objectionable conditions that constitute a nuisance" means disturbance of the peace, public intoxication, drinking alcoholic beverages in public, smoking or ingesting cannabis or cannabis products in public, harassment of passersby, gambling, prostitution, loitering, public urination, lewd conduct, drug trafficking, or excessive loud noise.
        <br> (3) "Reasonable steps" means all of the following:
        <br> (A) Calling the local law enforcement agency. Timely calls to the local law enforcement agency that are placed by the licensee, or his or her agents or employees, shall not be construed by the Bureau as evidence of objectionable conditions that constitute a nuisance.
        <br> (B) Requesting those persons engaging in activities causing objectionable conditions to cease those activities, unless the licensee, or his or her agents or employees, feel that their personal safety would be threatened in making that request.
        <br> (C) Making good faith efforts to remove items that facilitate loitering, such as furniture, except those structures approved or permitted by the local jurisdiction. The licensee shall not be liable for the removal of those items that facilitate loitering.
        <br> (4) When determining what constitutes "reasonable steps," the Bureau shall consider site configuration constraints related to the unique circumstances of the nature of the business.
        <br> (c) Notwithstanding that the licensee corrects the objectionable conditions that constitute a nuisance, the licensee has a continuing obligation to meet the requirements of subdivisions (a) and (b), and failure to do so shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to this section.
        <br> (d) If a licensee has knowingly permitted the illegal sale, or negotiations for the sales, of controlled substances or dangerous drugs upon his or her licensed premises. Successive sales, or negotiations for sales, over any continuous period of time shall be deemed evidence of permission. As used in this section, "controlled substances" shall have the same meaning as is given that term in Article 1 (commencing with Section 11000) of Chapter 1 of Division 10 of the Health and Safety Code, and "dangerous drugs" shall have the same meaning as is given that term in Article 2 (commencing with Section 4015) of Chapter 9 of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code.
        <br> (e) If the licensee has employed or permitted any persons to solicit or encourage others, directly or indirectly, to buy such persons cannabis goods in the licensed premises under any commission, percentage, salary, or other profit-sharing plan, scheme, or conspiracy.
